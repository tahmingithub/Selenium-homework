we test software in 2 ways:

1:manual testing -
ex: facebook; you test , am i able to login when i enter user name and password on facebook. manual testing it create
 problem because  it takes time to test every single product , it takes time .
2: automation
What tools we use to automate a website?
 selenium.
 What is selenium:
 is a tool that help us to automate webApplication


 HTML: it is a coding language tool ,

 <button>     button  is a tag it is between <>
 <image>    image a tag
  when there is iamge.

 < html>        < open of tag
 <head>                                         child
 <body>
 </html>         </ >close of tag

 1:    every open htlm should have a closing tag. ex :    <html>    open
                                                      </html>   close



  <h2  title ="Im a header">    the tile  /h2>        =>h2 is tag  , title is attribute  , value of attribute is header
  <image  style = "width 123"
    - imag is tag, style is attribute , width is value of attribute
   2:    attribute make changes to the image and information

   3:    text- it is between open and close of a tag . ex:
    <h2>   image as a link  </h2>         image as a link=> text


 ex:    <button  style ="40px"> hello< /button>
    <button is tag
    style is attribute that has value 40px
    hello is text , cuz it is between open tag and close tag


   ex:  facebook login user name , pass, login
   <html>
   <input>       =>username
   <input>      => username
   <button>  login  </button>           => login
   </html>
